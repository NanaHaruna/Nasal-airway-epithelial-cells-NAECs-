<h1>Data Analysis - Nasal-airway epithelial cells (NAECs) </h1>

 ### [Single cell profiling to determine influence of wheeze and early-life viral infection on developmental programming of airway epithelium ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39026695/)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of the scripts used in the analysis in this research paper. The data consisted on 9 scRNA-seq data sets obtained from sequencing nasal airway epithelial cells from children age 2-3 years from four mutually exclusive groups of wheezers/non-wheezers and RSV-infected/uninfected in the first year of life. The data was sequenced on 10x Genomics and the raw sequencing data was processedusing the CellRnager pipeline. Detailed in teh scripts are the methods of integration and downstream analysis to generate figures and data used in the researcg paper.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
Although childhood asthma is in part an airway epithelial disorder, the development of the airway epithelium in asthma is not understood. We sought to characterize airway epithelial developmental phenotypes in those with and without recurrent wheeze and the impact of infant infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nasal airway epithelial cells (NAECs) were collected at age 2-3 years from an a priori designed nested birth cohort of children from four mutually exclusive groups of wheezers/non-wheezers and RSV-infected/uninfected in the first year of life. NAECs were cultured in air-liquid interface differentiation conditions followed by a combined analysis of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and in vitro infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). NAECs from children with a wheeze phenotype were characterized by abnormal differentiation and basal cell activation of developmental pathways, plasticity in precursor differentiation and a delayed onset of maturation. NAECs from children with wheeze also had increased diversity of currently known RSV receptors and blunted anti-viral immune responses to in vitro infection. The most dramatic changes in differentiation of cultured epithelium were observed in NAECs derived from children that had both wheeze and RSV in the first year of life. Together this suggests that airway epithelium in children with wheeze is developmentally reprogrammed and characterized by increased barrier permeability, decreased antiviral response, and increased RSV receptors, which may predispose to and amplify the effects of RSV infection in infancy and susceptibility to other asthma risk factors that interact with the airway mucosa.
